# Map the custom subdomain directly to the Cloud Run service (no load balancer).
# Google provisions and manages the TLS certificate for the mapped domain. Unlike
# the web app, the API service stays a public (`allUsers`) Cloud Run invoker —
# no IAP here, since auth is handled in the application layer
# (GoogleIdTokenAuthDecorator) for both browser users and the worker.
#
# This root is applied by the shared org-level domain-mapper service account,
# which is a verified owner of the domain (a one-time org bootstrap performed in
# the `meta` repo) — so no per-project domain-ownership step is needed.
